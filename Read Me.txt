Read me:
Summary:
	This is a Mandelbrot Fractal Renderer(using C++ and OpenGL). Rendering and coloring is done using the Escape Algorithm and Continous (smooth) coloring algorithm. 
Libraries:
	GL3W 2-20-2019 (Last Commit) 
	GLM0 .9.9.5 (2019-04-01)
	STB Image 2.22
Notes:
	Max Zoom is locked at 1,000,000x.
	Current Max Iteration is 1000. Any higher leads to some crashes.
Controls:
	Left Click: Zoom in on cursor point
	Right Click: Zoom out on cursor point
Future Goal: 
	The main idea for this project is for user to select between multiple type of fractals to render. As fractal rendering should then be saved as a picture.
	The user could select to alter his/her background screen to cycle through the pictures.
